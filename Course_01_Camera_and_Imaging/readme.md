## What is computer vision and what are some of its real-world applications?

Computer vision is the enterprise of building machines that can “see.” Real-world applications of computer vision include self-driving cars, biometrics, security, visual inspection, factory automation, robotics, computer graphics, virtual reality, augmented reality, human-computer interfaces, medical imaging, scientific imaging, and digital imaging.

## What jobs can I get with computer vision skills?

Candidates with a strong foundation in computer vision are in extremely high demand today. Virtually all AI and data science companies are looking for skilled computer vision engineers and scientists. Vision engineers and scientists are also in very high demand in the fields of manufacturing, automation, robotics, biometrics, security, and visual inspection and metrology.

## What background knowledge is necessary?

Students are required to know the fundamentals of linear algebra and the fundamentals of calculus. No prior knowledge of imaging or computer vision are assumed. The knowledge of any programming language would enable the student to understand how the methods described in the course can be implemented in software. However, the knowledge of a programming language is not required as the course does not have programming assignments.
