## üìù Questions

### 1.

**Consider that we are working with a pinhole camera and an object is present at a distance of z‚ÇÄ in front of the camera. How would the magnification be affected if we moved the object away from the camera?**

- The magnification would decrease
- The magnification would increase
- The magnification would remain the same
- None of the above

### 2.

**Consider two blurry images captured from two cameras A and B. A has diameter less than ideal size and B has diameter more than ideal size. Is it possible to tell which camera captured which image?**

- Yes
- No
- Yes, if the diameter and focal length are given

### 3.

**Given a pinhole camera whose focal length is 2mm. Calculate the coordinates of the vanishing point of all the parallel lines in the real world which are parallel to the line passing through the point (0.1m, 0.3m, 0.1m) and the pinhole.**

- 2mm, 6mm
- 2m, 6m
- 1mm, 0.66mm
- 1m, 0.66m


### 4.

**An image can only be formed on the focal point.**

- True
- False

### 5.

**Lenses perform perspective projection.**

- True
- False

### 6.

**Why do we use lenses when we have pinhole camera?**

- Cameras with lenses are easier to manufacture than pinhole cameras
- Lenses gather more light than pinhole cameras, reducing exposure time
- Lenses can be stacked to produce a clear image of the scene
- Lenses keep parallel lines from the scene, parallel in the image

### 7.

**How many planes of focus does a fixed lens have?**

- 1
- This depends on the object‚Äôs distance from the lens in the scene
- There are multiple; however, an exact number cannot be defined
- Infinite


### 8.

**If a point in 3D space produces a blur circle with radius greater than pixel size, then it is in focus.**

- True
- False

### 9.

**An object at a distance 20mm and an object at a distance 60mm produces a blur circle with a radius less than pixel size. If you move these objects any further the blur circle might be greater than the pixel size. Calculate the depth of field (DoF) for the system.**

- 80mm
- 0.8m
- 40mm
- 60mm

### 10.

**An object R at 50mm from a convex lens produces an image on an image plane. There are two other objects - Object 1 is at a distance of 5mm behind R and Object 2 is 5mm in front of R. What can you say about the amount of blur produced by Objects 1 and 2?**

- Both objects produce same amount of blur
- Object 2 produced more blur than object 1
- Object 1 produces more blur than object 2
- Cannot determine from the information given


### 11.

**What is the _main reason_ to use a series of lenses, rather than use one lens, in real cameras?**

- To gather more light
- To capture images at different distances from the camera
- To capture high quality image over all part of the image

### 12.

**Distortion matrix represents the distortion caused by a lens. Is it possible to correct Radial distortion if we know the distortion matrix?**

- Yes
- No

### 13.

**What is image formation?**

- Projection of points from 2D plane to 3D scene
- Projection of points from 3D scene to 2D plane

## ‚úÖ Answers

### 1.

**Answer:** The magnification would decrease  
**Explanation:** Magnification is inversely proportional to the distance of objects in the real world.

### 2.

**Answer:** No  
**Explanation:** Due to diffraction, both smaller and larger than ideal diameters produce similar blur.

### 3.

**Answer:** 2mm, 6mm  
**Formula:** \( (x, y) = (f \cdot x_z/z_s, f \cdot y_z/z_s) \)


### 4.

**Answer:** False  
**Explanation:** An image forms at the focal point only if the object is infinitely far away and on the optical axis.

### 5.

**Answer:** True  
**Explanation:** Lenses follow the same principles of perspective projection.

### 6.

**Answer:** Lenses gather more light than pinhole cameras, reducing exposure time  
**Explanation:** Lenses collect more light and focus it to a point, enabling quicker image capture.

### 7.

**Answer:** 1  
**Explanation:** A fixed lens has only one plane of focus.


### 8.

**Answer:** False  
**Explanation:** A point is in focus only if its blur circle is within one pixel size.

### 9.

**Answer:** 40mm  
**Explanation:** DoF = 60mm - 20mm = 40mm

### 10.

**Answer:** Object 2 produced more blur than object 1  
**Explanation:** Closer to lens = more rapid defocus.


### 11.

**Answer:** To capture high quality image over all part of the image  
**Explanation:** A series of lenses ensures consistent image quality across the frame.

### 12.

**Answer:** Yes  
**Explanation:** Radial distortion can be corrected using the distortion matrix.

### 13.

**Answer:** Projection of points from 3D scene to 2D plane
