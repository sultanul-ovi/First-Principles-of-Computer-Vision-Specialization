# 🚀 My Journey Through the First Principles of Computer Vision Specialization

## 📚 Coursera Specialization | 5 In-Depth Courses

### 🔍 Why I Took This Specialization

As someone passionate about **AI and computer vision**, I wanted to go beyond just using pre-trained models and actually **understand how vision works**—from the physics of light to the algorithms behind object recognition.

This **5-course specialization** took me on a **deep dive** into the **mathematics, physics, and core principles** that form the backbone of modern computer vision. Unlike other courses that jump straight into deep learning, this one builds intuition **from the ground up**.

If you’re serious about **mastering computer vision from first principles**, this is the perfect course to challenge and transform the way you think about images, 3D reconstruction, and perception.

## 🎯 My Biggest Takeaways

✅ **Cameras are more than just sensors** – I learned how images are formed, the physics of light, and how modern image sensors work.  
✅ **Features & edges drive object recognition** – Before AI can "see," it first needs to detect edges, corners, and patterns.  
✅ **Reconstructing 3D from 2D images is mind-blowing** – Understanding **stereo vision, optical flow, and depth estimation** gave me a whole new appreciation for AR/VR and robotics.  
✅ **Tracking objects and recognizing them is an art & science** – Computer vision isn’t just about detecting objects, but also **understanding motion, segmenting images, and recognizing patterns** in a robust way.

Each course built on the previous one, making me feel like I was **slowly unlocking the vision system of an AI from scratch**.

## 🛠 The Hands-On Learning Experience

The **best part**? This wasn’t just about theory. I got to apply everything through:

🔹 **Image Processing** – Cleaning up noisy images, denoising, and filtering  
🔹 **Feature Extraction** – Detecting edges, corners, and keypoints  
🔹 **3D Reconstruction** – Building depth maps and scene structures  
🔹 **Segmentation & Recognition** – Tracking objects and classifying them

With **250+ interactive assessments**, I wasn’t just learning—I was building real skills that are actually useful in the field of AI and vision research.
