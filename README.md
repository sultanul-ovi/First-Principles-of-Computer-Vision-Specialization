### 🔍 Why I Took This Specialization

As someone passionate about **AI and computer vision**, I wanted to go beyond just using pre-trained models and actually **understand how vision works**—from the physics of light to the algorithms behind object recognition. This **5-course specialization** took me on a **deep dive** into the **mathematics, physics, and core principles** that form the backbone of modern computer vision.

## 🎯 My Biggest Takeaways

✅ **Cameras are more than just sensors** – I learned how images are formed, the physics of light, and how modern image sensors work.  
✅ **Features & edges drive object recognition** – Before AI can "see," it first needs to detect edges, corners, and patterns.  
✅ **Reconstructing 3D from 2D images is mind-blowing** – Understanding **stereo vision, optical flow, and depth estimation** gave me a whole new appreciation for AR/VR and robotics.  
✅ **Tracking objects and recognizing them is an art & science** – Computer vision isn’t just about detecting objects, but also **understanding motion, segmenting images, and recognizing patterns** in a robust way.
